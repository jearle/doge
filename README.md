# Exercise

React boilerplate required npm `>= v3`.

Tested with:

+ `node v6.2.1 ` and `npm v3.9.3`
+ `node v7.10.0` and `npm v4.2.0`

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs on: `http://localhost:53673`

## Responsive Design

It's semi responsive but looks best on narrower screens.  I did not setup a resize listener to dynamically resize the application, so you will need to refresh to get a proper responsive resize.
